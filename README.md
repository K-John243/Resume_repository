1. **Machine Learning R**: A project written in R designed to execute and compare two K-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithms from different packages. The file titled "DA5030.P1.Keith.pdf" is an R Markdown knitted pdf containing some echoed code and all of the figures/explanation of the project. The K-nearest neighbor algorithms are implimented on a dataset containing rows that represent different patients. For each row, there are several columns/features that respresent different attributes of the patient's tumor. The Knn algorithms are used to predict if the tumor is malignant or benign based on the previous diagnoses of the most similar tumors.

2. **Unigene_Tissue_Expression_Project**: A python program I coded to take a user input of a gene and a host (from a list of available genes and hosts from the unigene data set), and outputs a list of tissues that the gene is expressed in within the host organism. This program is robust, enabling the user to query a host in various different ways without breaking the program. It also uses a couple of different modules I coded with functions that allow the entire project to be fairly short and comprehensible. Please read the README.md within the project directory for more details on how to download the data file and run the program.

3. **DBC T-Maze Video:Audio.mp4**: A video I made using neuronal data (converted into midi data) that was retrieved using the neuronal probe made by DBC during a T-maze experiment with a mouse. To make the audio corresponding to the video, I applied the midi neuron plots to different channels within an AWS (audio work station), and had the different channels playing different instruments. You can also hear the different instruments (corresponding to neuronal groups within the mouse) get louder as the nueronal groups fire more.
